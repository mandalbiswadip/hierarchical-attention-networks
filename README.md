```
git clone https://github.com/mandalbiswadip/sentiment_analysis.git
cd sentiment_analysis
unzip data.zip
```
Train accuracy: 85 %

Test accuracy: 81 %


Upcoming work:
* Why word2vec is very bad choice in this case and what other simple embeddings can be used
* Visualizing and understanding the trained network and make sense out of the patterns recognized by the model
* Try a simple self-attention network to find out the patterns
